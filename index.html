                    <p>Organisations play a huge role in this process. They can set good environmental standards for employees, and the general public. They can do so by staying compliant with the UK and EU rules and regulations that promote green practices.
                        By doing so, they build a positive public image and people will use their resources or services more.</p>

                        <h3>Oil Drilling:</h3> <br> This issue is one that causes a great deal of environmental destruction. Our dependence on fossil fuel is a global addiction that affects every aspect of the world. Oil spills and offshore drilling poison
                        marine life, oil drilling (on land) suffocates the earth, and the combustion of fossil fuels add to the increased atmospheric CO₂, which in turns causes the progression of global warming and ocean acidification. This is a multifaceted
                        issue and is a good cause to get involved with because it covers such a broad spectrum of issues. </p>

                        <h3>Deforestation:</h3> Millions of acres of forest are cut down for industrial benefit, such as large scale farming, oil mining, and the production of paper goods. Deforestation causes wildlife and biodiversity extinction because
                        the loss of habitat threatens many species’ existence. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has a Red List of environmentally threatened species with up-to-date information.</p>

                        <h3>Production of Plastic Goods:</h3> Currently our society creates a great deal of waste and much of that waste consists of plastic. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010 alone 31 million tons of plastic waste
                        was created. This waste ends up all over the globe in both land and water, a good example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Not only is plastic waste an issue, but the production of plastic is also dependent on fossil fuel combustion.
                        According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2010 191 million barrels of liquid petroleum gases(LPG) and natural gas liquids (NGL) were used in the U.S. alone to produce plastic goods.
